can you make a documentation (.md is preferable) for full project and step by step?
like index page are index.html, there have two option.. login and signup, signup need email verification and on login have foregate password (update using email rand OTP), after login, (as par django model and custom userType, like student, teacher, it, admin, HR, sales, marketing, etc [as many possible]), all have there own (or if possible then share) dashboard. on a modern Institute Management System possible all action required, all member can update or even delete there own profile (delete need email OTP), admin have all power to add delete teacher, student or other member (using there power) but aspect student, need HR partition and finance clarification.
dashboard: admin can view all main feature like all member, sales, member or add delete them and manage there own profile, even register there own profile
others: can signup, but need accept/permeation on admin (all member), on HR (need for employee like teacher even another HR) and others as par rules
Delete: admin can delete all member, teacher can remove students from there course. All member can there own profile.

HR can make job post for other employee, and accept or delete (need signup for apply, admin, accounts and HR need to accept for adding new employee, if HR or accounts do not signup yeat, then admin can handle there job too), student can make account but need to course req teachers partition. even teacher also can add new course but need admin and salsas partition. even for course delectation req admin and salsas because it have balance factor. All create and delete or update req to save a model and have time laps.
